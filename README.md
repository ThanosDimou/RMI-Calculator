# RMI-Calculator
The program consists of two projects. The first project that we have to run with the title Server, contains the Server and the Implements class. If we run it, a message appears on the console for the successful or not operation of the server. Then we run the project Client which contains the client as well as the interface of the called methods. When running, the client displays a simple graphical calculator interface with the basic elements of entering numbers and arithmetic operations. There are two text_field to display the operations. The first is editable and is the field where we enter the numeric characters and the result of the operations is displayed. The second one is not editable and I used it to display the arithmetic operator so that the user knows which operation he performs in each step. You can enter numbers and operators both with the numpad directly and with the use of a mouse on each graphic key. In terms of operation, it is a simple RMI program that connects to the server at a predefined address and port and calls the methods for performing arithmetic operations.
